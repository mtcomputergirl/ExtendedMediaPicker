Extended Media Picker
=====================

An extended media picker for Umbraco 7 with whole picked image visible, plus the image name and a link to the image in the Media section.

Install via NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExtendedMediaPicker

Or just copy to the ~/App_Plugins folder and restart the Application Pool. You should be able to see the new editor in Developer when creating a new Data Type. You can also change the built-in Media Picker to use Extended Media Picker, as it stores the same data.

This Property Editor is based on the Media Picker in 7.1.4 with just some css and html hacks.
